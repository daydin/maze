maze
====

Code for the maze navigator e-puck robot written in C for Webots version 6. It includes repositories for the navigator and the "worlds" or environments in which a robot should navigate. Navigation is done by a recursive, one-layer neural network whose weights are evolving via an evolutionary algorithm.
